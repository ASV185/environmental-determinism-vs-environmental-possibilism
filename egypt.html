                            In Egypt, Camels have been part of Egypt since the Early Dynastic Period after 
                            several foreign conquerors such as Alexander the Great, the Assyrians, and the 
                            Persians, brought them to the country. They have been used in many different ways,
                            such as for transportation in the desert, as valuable livestock, and tourist attraction.
                           </p>
                            <p>
                            Camels are often called "ships of the desert" because of their ability to withstand heat, 
                            lack of water, and their incredible endurance. They can travel up to 100 miles in the desert,
                            even in temperatures as high as 120â„‰, without sweating or needing water.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Camels are also valuable livestock. Egyptians use them for their meat, and in some areas, camel liver
                            is a common breakfast. It's often sliced into bite-sized pieces and stir-fried with olive oil, green 
                            chilies, tomatoes, and a seven-spice blend that includes cardamom, cumin, and pepper. Camels truly play
                            a vital role in Egyptian culture and daily life!
