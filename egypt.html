        In Egypt, Camels have been part of Egypt since the Early Dynastic Period after 
        several foreign conquerors such as Alexander the Great, the Assyrians, and the 
        Persians, brought them to the country. They have been used in many different ways,
        such as for transportation in the desert, as valuable livestock, and tourist attraction.
       </p>
        <p class="p-2 m-3 mb-2">
        Camels are known as 'ships of the desert'. They have the ability to withstand heat and lack 
        of water, and endurance. Usually, camels can travel up to 100 miles in the desert, even in 
        temperatures of 120â„‰, without sweating or water.

        They are also valuable livestock. Egyptians use camels for their meat, and can eat camel 
        liver is a common breakfast in some areas. Camel liver is often sliced into bite-size pieces
        and stir-fried with olive oil, green chilies, tomatoes, and a seven spice blend that includes
        cardamom, cumin, and pepper.
