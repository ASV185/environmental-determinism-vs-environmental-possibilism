                In Egypt, Camels have been part of Egypt since the Early Dynastic Period after 
                several foreign conquerors such as Alexander the Great, the Assyrians, and the 
                Persians, brought them to the country. They have been used in many different ways,
                such as for transportation in the desert, as valuable livestock, and tourist attraction.

                Camels are known as 'ships of the desert'. They have the ability to withstand heat and lack 
                of water, and endurance. Usually, camels can travel up to 100 miles in the desert, even in 
                temperatures of 120â„‰, without sweating or water.

                They are also valuable livestock. Egyptians use camels for their meat, and can eat camel 
                liver is a common breakfast in some areas. Camel liver is often sliced into bite-size pieces
                and stir-fried with olive oil, green chilies, tomatoes, and a seven spice blend that includes
                cardamom, cumin, and pepper.
