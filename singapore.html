                In Singapore, they incorporated plants in various buildings to fight rising temperatures. This includes adding plants to the rooftops
                and gardens. Plants absorb light, create shade, and release water that cools the air. They reduce the building's carbon footprint and 
                it all saves owners on air conditioning and energy costs. Singapore pays property owners up to 50% of the cost of installing green rooftops
                and facades.
