                            During the 1800s, For many Native Americans who lived in the Great Plains, bison (also known as buffalo) represented
                            their spirit and reminded them of how their lives were once free and in harmony with nature. Native Americans believed 
                            they shared the Earth with bison and other animal relatives. Bison have been a part of Native American lives for over 
                            10,000 years, providing food, clothing, shelter, and tools. They were honored through songs, dances, and prayers. In 
                            other words, Native Americans relied on bison for their survival and well-being.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the 1800s, Native Americans learned to use horses to hunt bison over greater distances. After traders introduced guns, 
                            millions of bison were killed, and the species faced extinction. Today, several tribes are working to bring bison back to 
                            their land and way of life.

                            Bison were a primary source of livelihood for Native Americans in the Great Plains, Northwest, and Rocky Mountains. They
                            used almost every part of the bison's body in various ways:
                            <br>
                            •Meat: For food
                            <br>
                            •Hides: For clothing, blankets, and lodging
                            <br>
                            •Horns & Bones: For tools and implements
                            <br>
                            •Brains: For grease to tan hides
                            <br>
                            •Stomachs: For bags and water containers
                            <br>
                            •Sinews: For bowstrings and thread
                            <br>
                            •Ribs: For sleds for children
                            <br>
                            •Hooves: For rattles
                            <br>
                            •Skulls: For sacred altars
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Bison were truly essential to the Native American way of life, and their efforts to restore bison populations continue to be a vital part of their cultural heritage.
