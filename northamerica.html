                For many Native Americans, Bison (also known as buffalo) represent their spirit, they reminded them of how their lives were
                once free, and harmony with nature. Native Americans believed they shared the Earth with bison and other animal relatives. 
                They have been a part of many Native Americans lives for over 10,000 years. They provided food, clothing, shelter, and tools,
                and were honored by them through songs, dance, and prayers. In other words, Native Americans would use bisons for their survival
                and well-being.

                In the 1800s, Native Americans learn to use horses to hunt bison over greater distances. After traders introduced guns,
                millions of Bisons were kills and faced extinction. Today, several tribes are working to bring bison back to their land
                and ways of life.

                Bison were a primary source of livelihood for Native Americans in Great Plains, Northwest, and Rocky Mountains. They
                used almost every part of the bison's body. These are several ways the would use the bison:
                <br>
                •Meat: For food
                <br>
                •Hides: For clothing, blankets, and lodging
                <br>
                •Horns & Bones: For tools and implements
                <br>
                •Brains: For grease to tan hides
                <br>
                •Stomachs: For bags and water containers
                <br>
                •Sinews: For bowstrings and thread
                <br>
                •Ribs: For sleds for children
                <br>
