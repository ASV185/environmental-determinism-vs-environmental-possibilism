            Insects have been a staple in Mexican cuisine for centuries. Long before the Spaniards arrived, they were a main source
            of protein in Mexico, known for being high in fiber, low in fat, and inexpensive. Many people believe insects are delicious
            and offer unique flavors and textures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some ways insects are used in Mexican cuisine:
            <br>
            •Tacos and Quesadillas: Chapulines (grasshoppers) can be added to tacos and quesadillas. They’re often boiled, fried, and
            seasoned with chili, lime, and garlic.
            <br>
            •Guacamole: Chapulines can be mixed into guacamole for an extra crunch.
            <br>
            •Bar Snacks: Chapulines make for a tasty bar snack.
            <br>
            •Spice Mixes, Salsas, and Mole Sauces: Chapulines, chicatanas (giant winged ants), and maguey worms are used in many spice mixes,
             salsas, and mole sauces.
            <br>
            •Food Colorant: Cochineal, a type of insect, is used as a natural food colorant.
            <br>
            •Street Food and Fine Dining: Chapulines can be found in both street food stands and high-end restaurants.
            <br>
            •Other Foods: Insects can also be found in dishes like omelets, tamales, chocolate truffles, and sorbets.
            <br>
            By region:
            <br>
            •Puebla: Escamoles (ant larvae) are eaten between March and May and have a delicate texture with a buttery, nutty flavor.
            <br>
            •Zapotitlán: Cuchamás (green caterpillars) are sold in markets and are a crispy snack, often fried with lime, chili, and onion, or used in tacos.
            <br>
            •Oaxaca: Chicatanas (giant winged ants) are a rare treat found mainly in Oaxaca. They can be pan-roasted with lime or mixed into salsas with chili, 
            garlic, and salt. They are featured in many dishes.
            <br>
            Insects add a unique twist to Mexican cuisine and show just how diverse and interesting traditional foods can be!
